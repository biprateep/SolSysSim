# SolSysSim
Python code to simulate and visualise the solar system dynamics using visual python.

Requires python 2.7

NOTE: The code uses the "classic" visual python (Vpython 6) which is now unsupported.

The code has not been tested on the new Vpython which is significantly different than the "classic" version.

A PDF file describing the algorithms and results are also added in the repo
